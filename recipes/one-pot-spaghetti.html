        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>One-pot spaghetti is a quick dish where pasta, sauce, aromatics, and seasonings all cook together in a single pot. The pasta absorbs the flavors directly from the simmering broth, giving it a richer taste. It’s a fast, low-cleanup meal that’s hearty and comforting.</p>

        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>7 ounces whole wheat spaghetti</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><u>Steps</u></h4>

        <ol>
        <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, oregano, and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer, stirring often, for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Break spaghetti into thirds and add to the pot; cover and simmer, stirring often, until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.</li>
